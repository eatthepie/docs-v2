# Open and Permanent Code

The Eat The Pie lottery system is built on the principles of transparency, security, and immutability. These fundamentals are essential for user trust and long-term system integrity.

## 📖 Open Source Foundation

The entire codebase is open source and freely available for anyone to review, analyze, or contribute to. This approach enables community-driven development and enhanced security through public code review.

## 🏗️ Immutable Smart Contracts

The smart contracts, once deployed are non-upgradable. This means:

- 🛑 The core functionality cannot be altered
- 🔒 Lottery rules are permanently set
- 🤝 The system will operate as intended indefinitely

## 🛠️ Limited Administrative Functions

To maintain maximum decentralization and trustlessness, admin capabilities are limited to three essential functions:

1. **Adjust Ticket Price** 🎟️ - Allows adaptation to WLD price volatility while maintaining accessibility.
2. **Change Fee Recipient Address** 💳

> **Note**: #1 require a 10 game buffer period before changes go into effect.
