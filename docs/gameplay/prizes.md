# Prize Pool

Prize pool is made up of all the ticket purchases for the game. Here's how the prize pool gets distributed:

## ðŸ’° Prize Categories

1. **Jackpot (60% of pool)** ðŸŒŸ: Requires all 4 numbers to be correct (in order)
2. **3 in-a-row (25% of pool)** ðŸ¥ˆ: Requires the first 3 numbers to be correct (in order)
3. **2 in-a-row (14% of pool)** ðŸ¥‰: Requires the first 2 numbers to be correct (in order)

## ðŸ§® Prize Distribution

- **Multiple Winners**: When there are multiple winners for a category, they share the prize pool for that category equally.
- **No Winners**: If there are no winners in a category, that portion of the prize pool gets transferred to the next game.
- **Cascading Wins**: Winning tickets are eligible for each category they qualify for. For example, a jackpot winner also wins the "3 in-a-row" and "2 in-a-row" prizes!

## ðŸ’¸ Fees

- A 1% fee is applied to the total prize pool, capped at 1m WLD max. Anything in excess of 1m WLD is automatically allocated to the prize pool.

> **Example**: If the total pool is 150m WLD, the fee would be 1m WLD instead of 150m WLD. The extra 50m WLD is put back into the prize pool, making the total prize pool 149m WLD.
